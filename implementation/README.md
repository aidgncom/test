# BEAT implementation

This directory is reserved for implementations of BEAT. Implementations placed here serve as reference examples of how BEAT may be used in different environments.

The authoritative definition of BEAT and its eight-state semantic layout is in the repository root README. Implementations in this directory must preserve the same semantic stream for any BEAT sequence.

BEAT license terms and compatibility obligations are defined in the repository root and follow the applicable GPL-3.0-or-later or AGPL-3.0-or-later. GitHub Repo: [https://github.com/aidgncom/beat](https://github.com/aidgncom/beat)

### Applications Across Domains

The following examples present representative applications of BEAT format across different domains while preserving its sequential, semantic stream. They do not limit or narrow BEAT's scope. For full details, refer to the Compatibility section in the root README.

**Finance domain example** `*action:price:quantity`
```
_trader-1:!open~182*nvda!orderbook-NVDA~941*buy-NVDA:188:40
_trader-2:!open~1*nvda!orderbook-NVDA~1*buy-NVDA:market:5000!warning

// Trade monitoring flags abnormal high-frequency bursts
```

**Game domain example** `*shoot/flow:kill^distance`
```
_player-1:!HP-100~34^231~121*shoot-auto/4^972~251^1682!HP-76~12^96!HP-24~5*shoot-single~11^80~107*shoot-single:1-kill
_player-2:!HP-100~1^3215!ban

// 1-second travel to 3215, clear speedhack spike, immediate ban
```

**Healthcare domain example** `*status:heartrate:bloodoxygen`
```
_wearable-1:!normal~60*good:HR-80:SpO2-98~60*good:HR-82:SpO2-97~60*good:HR-81:SpO2-98
_wearable-2:!normal~60*good:HR-82:SpO2-96~60*caution:HR-95:SpO2-92!priority-high~10*caution:HR-104:SpO2-88~10*danger:HR-110:SpO2-85!emergency

// Monitoring interval tightened from 60s to 10s upon risk escalation
```

**IoT domain example** `~time/flow*status:value`
```
_sensor-1:!start~100/100/100/100/100/100/100/100/100*temp:23.5
_sensor-2:!start~100/100/100*temp:23.5~86*temp:24.1~37*temp:26.4*alert:overheat!emergency~10!recovery~613!restart~100/100/100

// AI detected an abnormal state and triggered emergency recovery and restart
```

**Logistics domain example** `*action:reason`
```
_flight-1:!JFK~2112*load~912*depart~486*climb~8640*cruise!MEM~2514*unload~1896*sort~3798*depart~522*climb~32472*cruise!CDG~3138*unload
_flight-2:!JFK~2046*load~864*depart~462*climb~8424*cruise!MEM~872*ramp-hold:ground-capacity~6514*unload

// Abnormal flight activity identified through real-time monitoring
```

Here's a more intuitive way to see BEAT's benefits in the logistics domain.

BEAT can stream the entire daily schedule of a single aircraft in about 1KB of data. There are roughly 30,000 commercial aircraft in service worldwide. Archived for one year, all of that can fit on a 10GB USB drive.

On that drive, all key flight events from the first takeoff to the final landing of each aircraft are preserved in a form that requires no semantic parsing. It also reveals delay reasons and behavioral patterns that traditional tools often hide across separate logs.

For additional detail, BEAT can be extended with value parameters like `!JFK:pilot-LIC12345` or `*depart:fuel-42350L`, maintaining readability while adding precision.

### Applications Across Platforms

BEAT can also be handled natively on AI Accelerators (xPU). As a Semantic Raw Format with an eight-state semantic layout, BEAT is inherently optimized for massive parallel handling and large-scale AI training. Below is an example Triton kernel that encodes BEAT tokens directly in xPU memory.

**xPU platform example** `1-byte scan`
```python
s = srf == ord('!')	# Contextual Space (who)
t = srf == ord('~')	# Time (when)
p = srf == ord('^')	# Position (where)
a = srf == ord('*')	# Action (what)
f = srf == ord('/')	# Flow (how)
v = srf == ord(':')	# Causal Value (why)

# Binary-level BEAT scanning on xPU
```

xPU can scan BEAT sequences directly without any additional setup. The rest is just address arithmetic to load and store tokens. In short, it achieves binary-level performance while preserving the human readability of a text sequence.

This makes BEAT a natural fit for AI-driven analysis of large-scale event streams in domains such as robotics and autonomous driving. In these environments, its ability to be scanned at binary speed while still remaining directly readable to both engineers and AI models stands out as a clear advantage.

Humans learn the meaning of their actions as they acquire language. AI, by contrast, excels at generating language but struggles to autonomously structure and interpret the full contextual fabric (5W1H) of its own actions. With BEAT, AI can record its behavior as sequences that read like natural language and analyze that flow in real time (1-byte scan), providing the foundation for feedback loops through which it can monitor its own errors and improve its outcomes.
